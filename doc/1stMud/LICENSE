In compiling this code, you have agreed to the following restrictions on
any operating version of 1stMud code:

1) following all guidelines in the diku license (contained in the file 
   doc/license.doc)
2) following all guidelines in the Merc license (contained in the file
   doc/license.txt)
3) following all guidelines in the ROM license (contained in the file
   doc/rom.license)
4) The login message to your mud must contain a notice that it is based
   on 1stMud ROM Derivative (c) 2001-2003 by Ryan Jennings.  The help files
   must include a 1stMud entry, readable by all players, and unaltered
   from the file included with the source code, except as authorized
   by the 1stMud author(s). 
5) Anyone not wishing to follow terms of the 1stMud license shall be obligated
   to delete all copies of this code in their possession.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, failure to display full credits for 1stMud, ROM, Merc, and 
   Diku.

(In English, this means that Markanth is the only one allowed to release
1stMud source code, as apposed to 1stMud derived source code, and that you
cannot call your mud 1stMud even though it uses 1stMud code.  You also aren't
allowed to deal with code thieves)
